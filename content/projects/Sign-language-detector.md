### Project Overview
On the first day of the module we were assigned into random groups, within those groups we had to each pick a role we'd fulfill in the project. I ended up leading the project meaning I had to assign tasks towards each individual member as well as manage the overall trajectory that the project was heading into (I also did all the coding). Our first idea was to create a data-driven shopping website however we quickly came to realise that a lot of other groups were doing the exact same thing leading us to change the idea to a Sign Language Detector. 

*Core libraries used*
 - Mediapipe
 - Pickle
 - Sklearn
 - Tensorflow
 
 ### Difficulties within the project
We had a fair share of difficulties when working on the project. For one, nobody really knew how machine learning worked or how we would even implement and feed data into it. And two, some of our project members didn't really communicate and did the bare minimum. To fix the first issue we did some research on other projects that were similar to what we wanted to do, doing this got us most of the way there as we got a good idea of how things were meant to work and all we had to do is implement it. The second issue was quite iffy... I tried my best to communicate with those project members but to no avail, so instead I divided the tasks they were meant to do amongst other project members.

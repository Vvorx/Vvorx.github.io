      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-a-project-from-2023-first-study-year&#34;&gt;THIS IS A PROJECT FROM 2023 (First study year)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vvorx/SignLanguageDetector/&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Vvorx/SignLanguageDetector/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-overview&#34;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the module we were assigned into random groups, within those groups we had to each pick a role we&amp;rsquo;d fulfill in the project. I ended up leading the project meaning I had to assign tasks towards each individual member as well as manage the overall trajectory that the project was heading into (I also did all the coding). Our first idea was to create a data-driven shopping website however we quickly came to realise that a lot of other groups were doing the exact same thing leading us to change the idea to a Sign Language Detector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently I am a second year Bsc Computer Science student at the University of Huddersfield, Technology is not only my hobby but its also my life. I spend most of my time learning, reading, exercising and working on projects where I can apply my knowledge. This website is a hub for anything that I&amp;rsquo;d like to document or share :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

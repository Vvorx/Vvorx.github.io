I ended up leading the project meaning I had to assign tasks towards each individual member as well as manage the overall trajectory that the project was heading into (I also did all the coding). Our first idea was to create a data-driven shopping website however we quickly came to realise that a lot of other groups were doing the exact same thing leading us to change the idea to a Sign Language Detector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Understanding machine language and processor design is key, as the y86 ISA serves as the interface between high-level programming languages and hardware. The project is structured into three tasks that progressively build the program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning Objectives:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
